My bio says "cyclist". The image splashed across the homepage is from an iconic European cycling route: the undulating road to Cap Formentor in Mallorca, Spain.

So why all the posts about Covid-19?

(No, I didn't get it. At least not that I know of. And if I did, it doesn't seem to have left any lasting damage.)

To be honest, my complete lack of cycling fodder these days is a bit of a painful subject. I'll let the graphics speak for themselves.

(For you runners out there, [Smashrun](http://www.smashrun.com) does an absolutely fantastic job of visualizing and classifying your run data in a way that's actually fun. I'm totally jealous.)

## The bright spot: Github activity spikes!

The lemonade out of all these lemons is it left me with a lot more time, as well as the energy, to create a website and dust off this blog.

The upshot is I could finally share some of the Covid data explorations I've been working on since the first confinement.

That being said, I'm feeling a very strong need to blog about something, _anything_,  that's not Covid. So expect to see a bit more variety—including more of the cycling variety—shortly!
