My bio says "cyclist". The image splashed across the homepage is from an iconic European cycling route: the undulating road to Cap Formentor in Mallorca.

So why all these posts about Covid-19?

(No, I didn't get it. At least not that I know of. If I did, it doesn't seem to have left any lasting damage.)

To be honest, my complete lack of cycling fodder these days is a bit of a painful subject. I'll let the graphics speak for themselves.

(For you runners out there, [Smashrun](http://www.smashrun.com) does an absolutely fantastic job of visualizing and classifying your runs in a way that's actually fun.)

## The bright spot: Github activity spikes!

The lemonade out of all these lemons is it gave me left me with a lot more time & energy to dust off this blog so I could finally share some Covid data explorations.
