Last week I started looking at just how much incidence rates have changed since France went into confinement (again).

Since the start of 2nd confinement on Oct 28, they'd plunged!

At first, I was pretty stunned. And excited: who would have thought that 'confinement lite' could have such quick results?

It's even more impressive when you look at the percentage changes:

Seems a bit too good to be true, really.

## What about testing?

As we've heard before, in particular from some soon-to-be-ex-world-leaders, the more you test, the more cases you'll find per 100 000 population.

And vice-versa.

Sure enough, testing has nosedived as well.

## The final result
