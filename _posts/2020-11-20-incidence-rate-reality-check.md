Last week I started looking at just how much incidence rates have changed since France went into confinement (again) on Oct 28. 

They'd plunged!

At first, I was pretty stunned. And excited - who would have thought that 'confinement lite' could have such quick results? It's even more impressive when you look at the percentage changes:

## Oh wait - what about testing? 

The more you test, the more cases you'll find per 100 000 population. And vice-versa.

Sure enough, testing has nosedived as well.
