It's November 25 2020, and we're now almost 1 month into our second-wave confinement that started on Oct 28.

The good news: it's working.

## Recap of improvements since Oct 28 2020

* At the national level, all Covid metrics are decreasing, from incidence rates (positive tests per 100k population) to new deaths per day.

* Incidence rates peaked a few days after confinement, and have fallen to well below pre-confinement levels. Nonetheless, they are still very high.

* ICU occupancy by Covid patients has begun to decrease. From a peak of ~95% on Nov 16 it's now down to ~88% as of Nov 24. However this is still much higher than it was on Oct 28 (~59%).

## What does this mean for those living in France?

Ultimately, what it means is that Covid infections have slowed enough for the government to begin easing restrictions.

As of this Saturday (Nov 28):

* shops and small business like hairdressers will be allowed to re-open, with restrictions.

* places of worship can welcome worshippers, with restrictions.

* individuals still have to complete attestions before leaving home, but we'll be able to wander further: up to a 20km radius, and for up to 3 hours duration.

## What will happen for the holidays?

Interestingly, **further easing of restrictions is explicitly tied to improvements in the case numbers and ICU**. In other words, the ball is in our court.

If, by Dec 15, we can remain vigilant enough for:

* new daily cases to go down to 5000, AND
* ICU Covid occupancy descend to between 2500 to 3000 beds

 confinement will be lifted for individual travel in France, and more businesses will be allowed to-reopen and activities to resume.

## How achievable are these targets?

**Assuming current trends hold steady**:

* **Daily new cases < 5000**: very feasible

The last time we were as low as 5000 daily new cases was at the end of August, which might seem dauntingly far away.

However, new cases are dropping much faster than they were growing before confinement: since confinement started, we've already gone down from a peak of 60,000 cases to fewer than 10,000.

So dropping another 5000 cases/day over the next 3.5 weeks seems very do-able.

On the other hand..

* **ICU occupancy between 2500 & 3000 beds: challenging, but not impossible**.

The last time we had fewer than 3000 ICU occupied by Covid patients was Oct 28. But so far ICUs have been emptying slower than they filled up. This was the same pattern we saw after the ICU peak for the first wave.

Going from a peak of 4810 on Nov 16 to 3000 bed occupancy represents a 48% decrease.

For the first wave, it took 30 days to see a 48% reduction in occupancy, from April 8 to May 4.

As of Nov 25 we are 9 days past peak, and have 20 more days before Dec 15. In other words 29 days to achieve a similar reduction. That's encouraging: we're 1 day ahead!

On the other hand, let's look at ICU daily admissions (rather than occupancy).

Looking at the decrease for the first wave, you can see admissions decreased much faster than they have so far for the second wave.

My hunch is this is because ICU stress is country-wide for the second wave, unlike the first, so big occupancy decreases in one region are being offset by continued increases in another.

# Coming soon

Over the next few days I'll be updating the Covid Dataviz website to more clearly show if we're on target for meeting those numbers.

In the meantime, you can still see in more detail how incidence rates & ICU stress have been evolving [here](https://limegimlet.github.io/covid_dataviz).
