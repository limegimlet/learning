![French vaccine rollout](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.123rf.com%2Fphoto_71149621_stock-vector-eye-dropper-vector-illustration-clip-art-image.html&psig=AOvVaw0zsbvJGatj3aSnnzVNTOO8&ust=1609494181988000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCKD87q339-0CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAK)

"Au compte-gouttes" is my new French expression this week. It means *to dole out sparingly*, and is the expression invariably used by the French media to convey the speed and scale of France's vaccine rollout, which as of December 30 was 138.

Here's how that compares to many of our EU neighbours:

The official line is that the ~~languorous~~ cautious pace is intentional, in order to get the consent and then vaccinate the most vulnerable at the EHPADs. This is what has been said by the Health minister, Olivier Veran, "Monsieur Vaccin" Alain Fischer and last night echoed by the government spokesperson, Gabriel Attal.

They all make a big point of emphasizing the complexity, as they are taking the vaccine to the EHPAD residents, not vice versa, and imply that countries going faster (ie Germany) are frog-marching their elderly to giant vaccinodromes. Which is [false](https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20201226-in-germany-101-year-old-woman-first-to-receive-covid-19-vaccine).

I'm not going to argue (much) about complexity. The temperature constraints are well known. But it's so well known that one does wonder why it's still being cited as a reason for the slowness, especially as other countries also face the same challenges.

But what really annoys is me is implying that France is somehow going out of its way to protect their elderly, when other countries are doing that too, just much faster and they are also allowing other groups to get vaccines, notably healthcare workers.

[This comes after weeks of listening to them trumpet the fact that the 2nd confinement saw our incidence rates plummet so that we we had one of the lower incidence rates among our neighbours. While true, what was left unsaid is just how high our incidence rate had become prior to the nosedive, and the fact that we rank 18th _worldwide_ for deaths per 100k population. In fact, it's only in the last few weeks that the [US per capita Covid mortality finally surpassed that of France's](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-data-explorer?zoomToSelection=true&time=2020-07-01..latest&country=GBR~DEU~IRL~CHE~ITA~BEL~FRA~ESP~USA&region=World&deathsMetric=true&interval=total&hideControls=true&perCapita=true&smoothing=0&pickerMetric=new_cases_per_million&pickerSort=desc){:target="_blank"}.

So bragging about how far we brought down cases is a bit like bragging you lost 100 lbs while failing to acknowledge it might have been easier and ultimately healthier had you simply stopped yourself from reaching 300lbs in the first place.]

Given the facts:

* it's the season of family gatherings from across the country;
* it's the coldest time of the year and new studies confirm that cold, humid conditions are indeed ideal for Covid transmission;
* new cases are clearly on the upswing in 4 regions in the east half of France, even after factoring the 'excessive testing' done prior to Dec 24;
* we are stuck at a still-high plateau of hospital admissions and ICU occupancy;
* trained hospital and especially ICU staff is scarce in France, and they are exhausted after battling two waves in quick succession;
* There's a 50% more infectious variant of Covid that's been circulating in southeast England since at least September, and despite limited genetic sequencing capabilities in France, at least one confirmed case of this variant has already been found. Likely there are far more given the size of the expat communities on either side of the channel.

Doesn't it seem prudent to assume there will be a third wave and that front-line hospital and emergency staff (even those young bucks under 50) are both vulnerable and essential and so should be among the first to get the vaccine too? Especially so if there's in one of regions where the virus is circulating?

The conseil scientifique already warned the government on Dec 23, although that warning wasn't published until Dec 29.

Also, they have decided to combat France's extreme vaccine-phobia (40% of the population willing to get the vaccine) by....paperwork! First, there was an 86 page PDF to explain the process to the EHPADs (because they have lots of time to read 86 pages of dense text). One of the key points was residents needed to first have a face to face interview at least 4 days before the hypothetical injection day in which to give their informed consent. This informed consent is then used to determine how many doses will be required for that site. Then the day of (or *au jour J* as they call it here) another interview is required immediately before the jab, presumably to see if someone has changed their mind.

France is the only country to require this consent process. The resulting forms will become yet another dossier, accessible only by the Sécu and the patient's médecin traitant, in case of subsequent issues. In other words, rather than opting for a media campaign to win over the sceptics (nevermind provide a fast-track option for those who have no objections), the government has opted instead for CYA.

Meanwhile, here's what Italy—another sceptical country, with only 60% are willing to be vaccinated— is doing:
