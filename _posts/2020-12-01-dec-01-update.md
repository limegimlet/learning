14 more sleeps before we know if we can roam unrestricted.

How are things looking since the [November 27 update](2020-11-28-nov-27-update.md)?

## ICU looking good for now

The decrease in ICU occupancy has completely leveled off in the past 3 days. If this trend continues, it will make it much less likely to drop to 3000 by December 15.

**The numbers behind these projections**

Notice how the projection based on past 3 days, with virtually no change, sends the 'estimated days to reach target' way up, from 15 days to 97!

## The decrease in new cases is slowing

{% raw %}<iframe width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="//plotly.com/~limegimlet/593.embed?showlink=false"></iframe> {% endraw %}

The decreases in daily cases is starting to level off in past few days.

As a result, if you estimate how many more days are needed to reach 5000 cases using the last 3 days' average decrease, we'll miss it by one day.

However, using longer time-periods, we'd still make the target by Dec 15 for now.

### The numbers behind these projections

### Another worry: this data under-reports new cases

Like many other datageeks, I'm using the publicly-available Covid test data on [data.gouv.fr](https://www.data.gouv.fr/en/datasets/donnees-relatives-aux-resultats-des-tests-virologiques-covid-19/){:target="_blank"}.

Unfortunately, this data doesn't yet include the results of antigen tests, even though it's accounting for an increasing portion of test results.   

For the week of Nov 16-22, antigen tests accounted for ~10% of weekly positive results across France, and for ~32% in IDF and ~22% in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes. (Sources: [Le Monde](https://www.lemonde.fr/les-decodeurs/article/2020/11/27/comment-les-tests-antigeniques-compliquent-les-calculs-d-indicateurs-cles-de-l-epidemie-de-covid-19_6061414_4355770.html) and page 13 of the [SPF weekly update](https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/maladies-et-traumatismes/maladies-et-infections-respiratoires/infection-a-coronavirus/documents/bulletin-national/covid-19-point-epidemiologique-du-26-novembre-2020))

*This means the numbers in these plots underestimate the true number of daily positive cases, so the "distance" between where we are now and our Dec 15 target is actually larger.*

### Could this make us miss the target for daily cases?

Potentially.

Looking at the Dec 1 update from Santé Publique France, antigen tests accounted for 23% of positive cases in the past 24 hours (1882 cases out of 8083 total):

[![SPF Dec 1 tests numbers](../../assets/images/2020/dec1_SPF_update.png)](https://www.santepubliquefrance.fr/dossiers/coronavirus-covid-19/coronavirus-chiffres-cles-et-evolution-de-la-covid-19-en-france-et-dans-le-monde#block-266151){:target="_blank"}

On Sunday Nov 30, the website showed the antigen tests accounted for an even higher proportion (38%). However, that could is probably due to PCR results always being lower on the weekend, since many of the labs that perform them are closed.

(This is why plots usually show 7-day rolling averages for anything to do with testing, to smooth out these intra-week variations)

To compensate for under-reporting positive cases, we can make the target correspondingly more difficult.

Below you can see how reaching the target could become trickier.

### Agggh - enough already! What's the takeaway?

You can probably guess what I'll say here. If deconfinement on Dec 15 is important to you, you can help make it still possible by:

* reducing your interactions as much as you can.
* wear a mask over both nose and mouth, especially when you are talking.
* regularly opening the window when you're in a closed space with other people.
* and of course, washing your hands.
