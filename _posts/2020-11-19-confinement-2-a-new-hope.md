Let's start this blog on a cheerful note. 3 weeks into our 2nd confinement here in France, the not-so-big secret is it is indeed getting better.<sup>*</sup>

<sup><b>*</b> but since we're talking about Covid-19, the ~~true~~ more complete answer is never that simple.</sup>

## Hospital occupancy going down

The most solid evidence is in the hospitals: the number of patients **currently occupying** regular hospital or ICU beds have not only flattened, but have even begun to go down .

## New admissions going down even faster

You can also see that **new patient admissions** to hospital and ICU are going down even faster. This naturally bodes well for future hospital & ICU occupancy too.

## New deaths may be flattening

Daily Covid deaths are now barely increasing, and you can only really see the increase by zooming in on the last few days. Since ICU occupancy as well as new admissions are already decreasing, we can expect to soon see deaths level off. 

This lag is to be expected: most patients will spend time fighting against Covid in hospital or ICU before they pass away.

Another sobering thought to keep in mind: not all Covid deaths are in the hospital. To date, EHPADs (senior homes) account for ~1/3 of total Covid deaths. 

(Deaths in EHPAD are only reported 2x a week, so there are no daily numbers. But as of Nov 10 there were 13000 cumulative EHPAD deaths, and nearly 29000 cumulative deaths in hospital).

## Next update: an incidence rate reality check

In my next post, I'll explain that the plunge in incidence rates, while definitely a clear trend, is not _quite_ as spectacular as some news articles has made it sound.
