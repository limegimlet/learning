Let's start this blog on a cheerful note. After 3 weeks, the not-so-big secret is _it's getting better_<sup>*</sup>. 

The most solid evidence is in the hospitals: the number of patients **currently occupying** regular hospital or ICU beds have not only flattened, but have even begun to go down .

You can also see that **new patient admissions** to hospital and ICU are going down even faster. This naturally bodes well for future hospital & ICU occupancy too.
